# Ai-Guardian
This project aims to create a system that helps physically incapacitated or disabled individuals request aid through accessible channels. The AI assistant, similar to a nurse, will use hand gestures, head movements, and eye tracking to facilitate communication and contact authorities, ensuring timely assistance.
